got myself a ###### yesterday 
and tethered it out there in the yard; 
but when I looked out the window 
I noticed it looked glum, moody and testy 
so I went out to see what I could do
I tickled my ######  
and he cackled and laughed a lot 
and he hee-hawed aloud - 
but yeah, you can bet your **** 
I got the bigger kick out of it


my ###### died

You remember the ###### 
I bought some time ago?  
Well, I stopped feeding it for a week 
and the stupid animal died  
just as it was finally learning to survive 
on clean air, positive thoughts and vibes


that's a ###### on the table

so my ###### died 
and in my grief I lay it on the best table 
and I drank and drank  

and people who came to mourn 
brought some hay 
but some of them said, after two days 
(and I was still drinking-mourning): 
"You can't just leave that lyin' on the table  "


"That's not a lion, you idiot! "
I barked at each one of them
"That's my ###### on the table! "
And so I'd demonstrated my ability 
to stay sober 
and retain my ****-picuity 
in spite of days of grief 
and like me I am sure you too 
cannot but marvel at people's inability 
to distinguish between a lion and a ######


###### ride

now that my ###### is dead 
it makes me reminisce
 about the good times we had 
____  

We were in the car 
my ###### and I  
as I took it for a weekend ride
